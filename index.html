        <h1><b>Building a MicroPython port for QEMU on Zephyr RTOS</b></h1>
      </div>
      <div>
        This blog covers the details and technicalities of the process of
        building a MicroPython port for QEMU on Zephyr RTOS which will be
        flashed on the BeagleConnect Freedom Board.

      <h3 id="1">The BeagleConnect Freedom</h3>
      <p>
        BeagleConnect is a revolutionary technology which eliminates low-level
        software development for IoT and IIoT applications, such as building
        automation, factory automation, and home automation. What sets it apart
        is that it eliminates the need of relying on software libraries enabling
        it to be used for interfacing a greater number of sensors, actuators and
        indicators for communicating over various networks compared to other
        conventional solutions. This can be achieved since it is built with
        fully open source software with submissions to mainline Linux and Zephyr
        repositories to aide in support and porting.
      </p>
      <p>
        BeagleConnect Freedom wireless hardware is based on the TI CC1352 and is
        multiprotocol and multi-band Sub-1 GHz and 2.4-GHz wireless
        microcontroller (MCU).The first available BeagleConnect solution.
        BeagleConnect currently has Greybus support which is an application
        layer protocol that can be described as a bus transport, in that it
        conveys bus-specific messages back and forth between Linux and a
        connected device.
      </p>
      <p>
        The motive of this project is to port MicroPython and CircuitPython to
        the firmware to be flashed on the BeagleConnect Freedom as well as
        writing MicroPython drivers for the the BeagleConnect Platform. In this
        Blog we will explore the building process for the Zephyr RTOS which
        basically one step prior to the process of flashing it on the hardware.

      <h3 id="2">What is MicroPython?</h3>
      <p>
        MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3
        programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard
        library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained
        environments.
      </p>
      <ul>
        Features supported by the MicroPython Port to Zephyr RTOS are:
        <li>REPL (interactive prompt) over Zephyr UART console.</li>
        <li>utime module for time measurements and delays.</li>
        <li>machine.Pin class for GPIO control, with IRQ support.</li>
        <li>machine.I2C class for I2C control.</li>
        <li>usocket module for networking (IPv4/IPv6).</li>
        <li>
          "Frozen modules" support to allow to bundle Python modules together
          with firmware. Including complete applications, including with
          run-on-boot capability.
        </li>
        <li>
          virtual filesystem with FAT and littlefs formats, backed by either
          DiskAccess or FlashArea (flash map).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 id="3">Setting up Zephyr RTOS</h3>
      <p>
        I have used the fedora distribution and will be sharing commands for the
        same. However documentation and support is available for Ubuntu, Fedora,
        Clear Linux, Arch Linux along with Windows and macOS.
      </p>
      <ol>
        The following steps need to be followed. I have shared the respective
        commands for the corresponding steps.
        <li>
          Update Your Operating System:<br />Ensure your host system is up to
          date.<br />$ sudo dnf upgrade
        </li>
        <li>
          Install Requirements and Dependencies:<br />Note that both Ninja and
          Make are installed with these instructions; However we will need only
          one.
          <ul>
            <li>
              $ sudo dnf group install "Development Tools" "C Development Tools
              and Libraries"
            </li>
            <li>
              $ dnf install git cmake ninja-build gperf ccache dfu-util dtc wget
              \ python3-pip python3-tkinter xz file glibc-devel.i686
              libstdc++-devel.i686 python38 \ SDL2-devel
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Install CMake:<br />CMake version 3.13.1 or higher is required.
          Download and install a packaged cmake from the CMake project site.
          <br />$ cd ~ <br />$ wget
          <a
            href="https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.15.3/cmake-3.15.3-Linux-x86_64.sh"
            >https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.15.3/cmake-3.15.3-Linux-x86_64.sh</a
          >
          <br />$ chmod +x cmake-3.15.3-Linux-x86_64.sh<br />
          $ sudo ./cmake-3.15.3-Linux-x86_64.sh --skip-license
          --prefix=/usr/local
          <br />$ hash -r
        </li>
        <li>
          Install the Zephyr Software Development Kit (SDK):<br />Use of the
          Zephyr SDK is optional, but recommended. Some of the dependencies
          installed above are only needed for installing the SDK.<br />Zephyrâ€™s
          SDK contains all necessary tools to build Zephyr on all supported
          architectures.<br />Additionally, it includes host tools such as
          custom QEMU binaries and a host compiler.<br />Download the
          <a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases"
            >latest SDK</a
          >
          as a self-extracting installation binary:<br />$ wget
          <a
            href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/download/v0.12.4/zephyr-sdk-0.12.4-x86_64-linux-setup.run"
            >https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/download/v0.12.4/zephyr-sdk-0.12.4-x86_64-linux-setup.run</a
          ><br />Run the installation binary, installing the SDK at
          ~/zephyr-sdk-0.12.4<br />$ cd &lt;sdk download directory&gt;<br />$
          chmod +x zephyr-sdk-0.12.4-x86_64-linux-setup.run<br />$
          ./zephyr-sdk-0.12.4-x86_64-linux-setup.run -- -d
          ~/zephyr-sdk-0.12.4<br />We are now done with setup and installation
          process.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <div>
      <h3 id="4">QEMU</h3>
      <p>QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.</p>
      <p>
        When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made for
        one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your own
        PC). By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will be also using it for running the Zephyr RTOS and building
        MicroPython for the ARM Architecture on our x86 machine which can be
        later flashed on our actual hardware.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 id="5">Building port on Zephyr RTOS</h3>
      We don't have to redo the Zephyr installation, we have to just switch from
      master to a tagged release, we can instead do:<br />$ cd
      zephyrproject/zephyr<br />$ git checkout v2.5.0<br />$ west update<br />Once
      Zephyr is installed we may then need to configure your environment, for
      example by sourcing zephyrproject/zephyr/zephyr-env.sh<br />Once Zephyr is
      ready to use we can build the MicroPython port.<br />We will first have to
      clone the MicroPython repository into our home directory using :<br />$
      Git clone
      <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython"
        >https://github.com/micropython/micropython</a
      ><br />To build for QEMU we finally run<br />
      $ west build -b qemu_cortex_m3 ~/micropython/ports/zephyr<br />Once the
      port has been built successfully the resulting firmware is flashed to the
      BeagleConnect Freedom Board. A successful build looks as follows:<br />

      <img src="image2.png" alt="zephyrkconfig" /><br /><br />
